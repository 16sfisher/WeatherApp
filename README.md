# WeatherApp
User Story: AS A traveler I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly.

The app's function is to search a city name and receive the current weather, as well as the next 5 consecutive day's forecast. Under the current weather it will display the city name, current date, temp, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. The 5 day forecast shows the date, an icon representing that days expected weather conditions, temp, and UV index.
Each Time a search is made a button is created with the same city name as was just searched and locally stored in the browser.
